<h2>Bootstrap development service</h2>

<h3>Features discovering</h3>

<p>In this step we will discovery and discuss what are the main features of the project,
I will give a score for each feature based on the complexity.</p>

<h3>Features priorizing</h3>

<p>After discoverying and listing features we will priorize them and you can decide what of them will be
implemented, in the end of this step we will have a list of critical features and a plan.</p>

<h3>Implementing</h3>

<p>I will start implementing the features according priority, I use Heroku as platform so the bootstrap
is pretty fast, for each implemented feature you will be able to test and approve the draft. After
approval I will polish the feature and the flow will continue.</p>
