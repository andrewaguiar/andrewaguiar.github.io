When I started creating some web products and sites I always found my self with little options in terms of images, components and tools. Here I present a list of very usefull sites to help you in your work.

## HTML Frameworks
Create a website from scratch is not easy, you need create a default css, define some css classes, components and guidelines. For this reason I strongly recommend you to use a html framework
