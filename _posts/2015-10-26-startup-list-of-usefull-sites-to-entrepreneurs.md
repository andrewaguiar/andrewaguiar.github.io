When I started creating some web products and sites I always found my self with little options in terms of images, components and tools. Here I present a list of very usefull sites to help you in your work.

## HTML Frameworks
Create a website from scratch is not easy, you need to create a default css, define some css classes, components and guidelines. For this reason, I strongly recommend that you to use an html framework, this can save you a lot of time and put some order in your code.

In my case for example I don't have any great skill for chose color palettes, alignment, typography so an html framework helps me creating a minimally good presented site with low effort.

  - [getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com): Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web *(description extracted from getbootstrap website)*.
